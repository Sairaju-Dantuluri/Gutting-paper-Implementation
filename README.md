# Gutting-paper-Implementation
This is a Implementation of Guting-paper in C++ which is published in the 1960s to solve the contour and measure problem of Iso-rectangles that are parallel to axis in a O(n logn ) time complexity.

# Running the code
The input is given as n which is the number of inputs in the first line and the subsequent n lines take input as x1 x2 y1 y2 
where (x1,y1) is the left bottom point of the rectangle and (x2,y2) is the right top point of the rectangle parallel to the axis.

# Reading the output
the area
